# GSU Backend

This project serves as the backend for the GSU project.

The project utilises the following tech stack:

1. NodeJS
2. Typescript
3. MongoDB

## Installation

Node version: 18.19.0

To install the the dependencies, we need to do `npm install`.

To run the project, we need to do `npm run dev`.

The API should be running on port 6546 OR you can visit the following URL - `http://localhost:6546/api/v1/tasks` to access the APIs in your local environment.

## Backend Requirements ( Node.js, TypeScript )

[x] Set up a RESTful API using Express.js.

[x] Implement CRUD operations for managing tasks.

[x] Use TypeScript for type safety and better code organization.

[x] Integrate a database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL, InMemory) for storing tasks.

[x] Implement validation and error handling for API requests.

## Additional Info

I have added a bunch of things which I felt are essential -

1. API Versioning
2. Logging
3. Pagination for GET endpoints

Technique which I believe can be beneficial for our system when we hit a certain scale is

1. Caching ( either using redis / in-memory node cache )
